# DnD_Hub

## Features

* Dice Box
	* Roll individual die or multiple dice at once
* Custom roll parsing (e.g. 1d6 + 2d20 + 4)
* Load the map in a tab (may be changed to pop-out later)
* Save/Load character basics between opening and closing app
* Open multiple files at once using default process (save links in .txt file)

##TO-DO

###General
* Add support for custom rolls which will be saved 
* Advantage / Disadvantage
	* Colors to show the selected roll
* ToolTip to show results for individual die in dice rolls (e.g. 4d6 - hover to see 1,4,2,3)

### More character customization 
* Spell slots (checkboxes or direct typing?)
* Status (blind, incapacitated, etc)

### Database with spells. Access an API?

### Inventory tab which saves between sessions or saves to file and auto-loads?

## Known Issues
* Dice box modifier only supports positive mods. Need improved RegEx instead of String.Split
